### **Docker Hub Repository Overview for `mhmdhs/laravel-app`**

#### **Description**
This repository contains a Dockerized Laravel application, complete with the necessary services to run a full-stack web application. It includes a PHP-FPM container for the Laravel app, an Nginx container for serving the app, a MySQL database container, Redis for caching, and phpMyAdmin for managing the database through a web interface.

#### **Included Services**
- **Laravel App (PHP-FPM)**: The core container running the Laravel application. It is built using PHP 8.2 with necessary extensions installed, including Redis, MySQL, and various common extensions for Laravel.
- **Nginx**: A lightweight and fast reverse proxy and web server for serving the Laravel application.
- **MySQL**: A MySQL 8.0 database for storing application data.
- **Redis**: A Redis server for caching and session management.
- **phpMyAdmin**: A web-based database management tool for interacting with the MySQL database.

#### **How to Use**

##### **1. Clone the Repository and Set Up the Docker Containers**
First, clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

##### **2. Set Up the Environment**
Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured with the database credentials, such as `DB_HOST`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_DATABASE`. If youâ€™re using Docker Compose, ensure the environment variables are defined in the `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` file.

##### **3. Build and Start the Containers**
To get the app up and running, use the following command to start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:
- Build the necessary Docker images.
- Start the Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL, Redis, and phpMyAdmin containers.

##### **4. Access the Application**
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Laravel application via your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To access phpMyAdmin, go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You can use the database credentials from the `.env` file to log into phpMyAdmin.

##### **5. Stop the Containers**
When you're done, stop the containers by running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers but retain the data in the volumes.

#### **Features**
- Full Laravel development environment in a containerized setup.
- Pre-configured Nginx for serving Laravel.
- PHP extensions and Redis integration for optimal performance.
- A MySQL database and phpMyAdmin for easy database management.

#### **Prerequisites**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- A `.env` file or environment variables configured for your database and application.

#### **Configuration**
To configure the app, modify the following environment variables in the `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` file:
- **DB_HOST**: The database host (e.g., `db` for the MySQL container).
- **DB_DATABASE**: The name of your MySQL database.
- **DB_USERNAME**: The username for accessing the MySQL database.
- **DB_PASSWORD**: The password for the MySQL user.

#### **Customization**
You can customize the `docker-compose.yml` file to add other services, change the ports, or adjust container settings for your specific use case.

#### **Support**
For any issues or questions, open an issue in the repository or contact me via the repository discussions.
